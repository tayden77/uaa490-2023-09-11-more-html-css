He is the author of the multi-volume work 
The Art of Computer Programming and contributed
to the development of the rigorous analysis of 
the computational complexity of algorithms and 
systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process,
he also popularized the asymptotic notation.

In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches 
of theoretical computer science, 
Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, 
the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, 
and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.

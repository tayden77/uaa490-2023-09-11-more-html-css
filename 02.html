            Donald Ervin Knuth (/kəˈnuːθ/ kə-NOOTH; born January 10, 1938) 
            is an American computer scientist, mathematician, 
            and professor emeritus at Stanford University. 
            He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, 
            informally considered the Nobel Prize of 
            computer science.[4] Knuth has been called the 
            "father of the analysis of algorithms".

            He is the author of the multi-volume work 
            The Art of Computer Programming and contributed
            to the development of the rigorous analysis of 
            the computational complexity of algorithms and 
            systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process,
            he also popularized the asymptotic notation.

            In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches 
            of theoretical computer science, 
            Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, 
            the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, 
            and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.
